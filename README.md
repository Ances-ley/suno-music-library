Suno local music library for managing your tracks
# 🎵 Music Library for Suno - Free!

## Hi there

I asked **Claude (Anthropic)** to create a small application to manage my tracks, lyrics, prompts, dates, and notes. And honestly, it helped me so much that I thought: why not share it with you?

So here it is, it's for you, and I hope it helps you as much as it helped me!

## 🎯 What is it exactly?

A **local** music library (everything stays on your PC, nothing goes to the internet) where you can:

✅ **Store your WAV tracks** with their info  
✅ **Listen to them directly** in the interface  
✅ **Save your Suno prompts** (super important for copyright!)  
✅ **Keep your lyrics, creation dates, notes**  
✅ **Organize by language and type** (complete tracks / excerpts)  
✅ **Search** through your titles, lyrics, prompts  
✅ **Export/import** everything in one click  

**Ultra-simple interface:** Just the title and audio player, click to see details.

---

## 💾 Why is this important?

**For copyright and proof of creation**, you need to keep:
- The date you created the track
- The exact prompt you used
- The original lyrics

This app does all of that automatically.

---

## 🚀 How does it work?

**It's simple:**

1. **Download** the HTML file (link below)
2. **Double-click** on it → it opens in your browser
3. **Add your tracks** with the green "+ Add a track" button
4. **That's it!** Your tracks are stored locally

**No installation, no account, no server.** Just an HTML file that runs in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Safari... all work).

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Backups!

**Read this carefully, it's crucial:**

Your tracks are stored in your browser (IndexedDB technology) BUT:

❌ If you clear your browser data → **you lose everything**  
❌ If you change computers → **you lose everything**  
❌ If your browser crashes → **you lose everything**

**THE SOLUTION:**  
👉 Click on **"Export archives"** regularly (like once a week, or after each big session)  
👉 This creates a `.json` file with EVERYTHING in it (tracks, audio, lyrics, prompts, dates...)  
👉 Put this file in a cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox...) or on an external drive

**To recover your data:**  
1. Open the HTML file  
2. Click on "Import archives"  
3. Select your JSON file  
4. Everything comes back!

## 📊 How many tracks can I store?

**Thousands.** Literally.

With Chrome/Brave: up to 60% of your free disk space  
With Firefox: about 10% of your disk space  
With Safari: 1 GB+ (more than enough)

If your tracks are 3-5 MB on average, you can easily store **500 to 1000+ tracks** without issue. And even more if you have space.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**  
A: **NO.** Everything stays on your PC. Zero server, zero internet. 100% local and private.

**Q: Does it work on mobile?**  
A: Technically yes, but it's really designed for desktop. On mobile it'll be hard to upload WAVs.

**Q: Can I modify the colors / interface?**  
A: Yes! It's standard HTML/CSS/JS. If you know a bit of code, you can customize everything. Otherwise, it works perfectly as is.

**Q: Is it really free?**  
A: **Yes.** No ads, no premium, no tricks. Just sharing between creators.

**Q: Who made this?**  
A: Me (a Suno creator like you) with the help of **Claude** (Anthropic's AI). I needed a tool, Claude coded it for me, I'm sharing it. That's it! 🎉

**Q: Can I share / modify it?**  
A: **Absolutely!** Do what you want with it. If you share it elsewhere, just mention it was created with Claude, that's cool. But you're not obligated.

**Q: Does it work for things other than Suno?**  
A: Yes! Any type of WAV tracks. You can use it for any personal music library.

## ⭐ Bonus: Recommended workflow

**For each new Suno track:**

1. Generate your track in Suno
2. **Immediately copy the prompt** (important!)
3. Note the creation date
4. Download the WAV
5. If you edit in Audacity, note the modifications
6. Add everything to the library
7. **Export your archives** once a week

**For excerpts/alternatives:**
- Suno generates multiple versions → choose the main one
- The others → store them as "Excerpt"
- That way you keep everything and can reuse them later!

**Happy music creation! 🎵🎨**
